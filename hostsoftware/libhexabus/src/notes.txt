  
  
The hexapost command listens to energy readings broadcast in the Hexabus
network and POSTs them to a libklio store on a mySmartGrid server. On the
mySmartGrid server side, each libklio store is represented by a Flukso device,
and each hexaplug endpoint by a sensor.

The command bellow creates a new remote store on the production server
https://api.mysmartgrid.de:8443 and starts POSTing all energy readings
received on eth1 to the store.
   
        $ hexapost -Ieth1
   
   
For testing purposes, the user may also inform an alternative server URL,
store id and store key, as follows.
  
        $ hexapost -Ieth1 \\
                -uhttps://dev3-api.mysmartgrid.de:8443 \\
                -dd271f4de36cdf3d300db3e96755d8736 \\
                -k755d8736d271f40db3e96de36cdf3d30
   
   
In either case, the user receives instructions about how to link the store to
his account on the web site.
   
        $ MSG store https://api.mysmartgrid.de:8443/device/d271f4de36cdf3d300db3e96755d8736
          (activation code: d271f4de36)
          Please, go to http://www.mysmartgrid.de/device/mylist and enter the
          activation code above, in order to link this store to your account.
   
   
From now on, all readings and postings are printed on the screen.
